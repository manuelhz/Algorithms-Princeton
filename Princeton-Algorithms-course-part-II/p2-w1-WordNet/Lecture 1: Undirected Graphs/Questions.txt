1) A cycle that uses each edge of a graph exactly once is called ________________.

a) a simple cycle
->b) an Euler tour
c) a Hamilton tour
d) a path

2) What is the order of growth of the memory used to represent a graph with V vertices and E edges using the adjacency-lists representation?

a) V
Incorrect
What if there are many more edges than vertices?
b) E
c) E + V
Correct
The vertex-indexed array has length V. Each of the E edges is represented exactly twice in the adjacency lists.
d) V^2

3) In a graph G represented using the adjacency-lists representation, depth-first search marks all vertices connected to s in time proportional to ____________________.

a) the number of vertices in G
Incorrect
What if not many vertices are connected to s?

b) the number of edges in G


c) the number of vertices in the connected component containing s
Incorrect
What if there are many more edges than vertices in the connected component containing ss?


-> d) the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the connected component containing s.
Correct
Depth-first search will examine each vertex in the connected component containing s. It processes edge in this component twice (once in either direction).

4) The critical data structures used in depth-first search and breadth-first search are _______ and ________, respectively.



a) queue, queue
b) queue, stack
->c) stack, queue
Correct
With depth-first search it is either an explicit stack (with a nonrecursive version) or the function-call stack (with a recursive version).
d) stack, stack

5) In undirected graphs, the is connected to relation is _______________ .

a) reflexive
b) symmetric
c) transitive
->d) all of the above
Correct
The is-connected-to relation is an equivalence relation: it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

6) Which one of the following graph-processing problems is unlikely to have an algorithm whose running time is E + V?

a) determine whether a graph is bipartite
b) determine whether a graph has an Euler cycle
->c) determine whether a graph has a Hamilton cycle
Correct
The Hamilton cycle problem is NP-completeâ€”it is unlikely to have a polynomial-time algorithm. The other three problems can be solved in linear time.
d) determine whether a graph can be drawn in the plane such that no two edges cross
Incorrect
This can be solved in linear time, but all known planarity algorithms are very complicated (and beyond the scope of this course).
