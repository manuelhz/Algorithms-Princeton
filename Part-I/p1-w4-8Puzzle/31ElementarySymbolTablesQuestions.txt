1) Which value is associated with the key \verb#Hello#Hello after executing the following code fragment:

ST<String, Integer> st = new ST<String, Integer>();
st.put("Hello", 12);
st.put("World", 21);
st.put("Hello", 49);

a)12
=>b)49
Correct
The ST API specifies that put() overwrites the old value with the new value when called on a key already in the symbol table.
c)Both 12 and 49
d)Either 12 or 49, depending on the implementation

2) What is the maximum number of array accesses needed to search for a key in a symbol table that is implemented with a sorted array?

a)constant
->b)logarithmic
Correct
Use binary search.
c)linear
d)linearithmic

3) What is the maximum number of compares to determine the rank of a key in a symbol table that is implemented using a sorted array?
a)constant
->b)logarithmic
Correct
Use binary search.
c)linear
d)linearithmic

4) Suppose that nn distinct keys are inserted into a binary search tree in random order. What is the expected number of compares to search for one of the nn keys?

a)constant
->b)logarithmic
Correct
As stated in lecture, the expected number of compares is âˆ¼2ln(n).
c)linear
d)linearithmic

5) A BST is uniquely defined by its level-order traversal, a breadth-first traversal where the root is visited first, then all nodes at depth 1 (going from left to right), then all nodes at depth 2 (going from left to right), and so forth. What is the level-order traversal of the BST drawn below?
(.... bst.jpg ....)


a)A C E H M P R S X
b)A C H P M E S X R
c)R E C A M H P X S
->d)R E X C M S A H P
Correct
Note: To code up a level-order traversal, you would use a queue instead of a (function-call) stack.

6) What is the order of growth of the expected height of a binary search tree with n keys after a long intermixed sequence of random insertions and random Hibbard deletions?


a)logn
->b)sqrt{n}
Correct
The main defect of Hibbard deletion is that it unbalances the tree, leading to sqrt(n) height.
If instead of replacing the node to delete with its successor, you flip a coin and replace it with either its successor or predecessor, then, in practice, the height becomes logarithmic (but nobody has been able to prove this fact mathematically).
c)n
d)nlogn
