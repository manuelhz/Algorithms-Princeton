Question 1
4-SUM. Given an array a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine if there exist distinct indices i, j, k, and l such that a[i] + a[j] = a[k] + a[l]. Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 (under suitable technical assumptions).
Hint: create a hash table with n over 2 key-value pairs.
n over 2 =|n|
          |2|

Question 2
Hashing with wrong hashCode() or equals(). Suppose that you implement a data type OlympicAthlete for use in a java.util.HashMap.

a)Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but not equals().

b)Describe what happens if you override equals() but not hashCode().

c)Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but implement public boolean equals(OlympicAthlete that) instead of public boolean equals(Object that).

Hint: it's codeâ€”try it and see!
